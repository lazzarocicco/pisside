Before to try to execute random_play.pd

you need to install the pure data application.
Puredata (Pd) is a open source software.
You can download and install it for your specific system (windows, apple or linux) at 

[https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data)

There are some different flavour of puredata, I advice you tu use, as a beginner, the Miller Puckett's **"vanilla"** distribution of Pd.

After you have installed pure data, open the application and from the "file" menu, find and open the random_player.pd file.

As you know you will have to load an audio file into the program, remember that you can **only load .wav and .aiff** audio files. In this example You can NOT load an mp3 file.

Enjoy
